  "EngineeringGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 3119 lab support actor (physical and engineering science
  technicians). Wired as its own `:govern` node in `engineering.actor`'s
  StateGraph, downstream of `:advise` — the Engineering Advisor has no notion of
  sample provenance or analytical integrity risk, so this MUST be a
  separate system able to reject a proposal (itonami actor pattern, per
  ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. sample provenance      — the request's sample must be registered.
    2. protocol verification  — :run-test-protocol ops must reference a
                                registered test protocol.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose.
    4. equipment-exists       — :calibrate-equipment ops must reference
                                a registered equipment resource.

  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off):
    5. :flag-out-of-spec-result — always escalates (quality assurance
                                  safeguard, never silently dismissed).
    6. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
