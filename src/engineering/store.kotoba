(ns engineering.store
  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 3119 lab support actor (physical and engineering
  science technicians). Store is a protocol injected into the
  `engineering.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the default,
  deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed
  implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or
  governor (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section).

  Domain:

    sample       — a registered test sample (:sample-id, :project-id,
                   :description, :status)
    test-protocol — a pre-approved, registered analytical test procedure
                   (:protocol-id, :name, :expected-range)
    equipment    — a lab instrument/equipment resource (:equipment-id,
                   :name, :last-calibration)
    record       — a committed lab operation under a sample
                   (test execution, result logging, out-of-spec flag,
                   calibration procedure) — written ONLY via
                   commit-record!, never mutated in place
    ledger       — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
                   disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
